Discovering exoplanets from NASA's Kepler space telescope data

When a planet passes in between its star and us on Earth, there's a dip in the star's luminous flux (measure of the perceived power of light). Much like putting your hand between your eyes and the Sun. This can measured. We look for cyclic dips in the star's luminous flux. This is a sign that a planet is orbiting the star. This is how we hunt for exoplanets.

### Raw Data
The below graph shows a star's lumination over time. Notice the cyclic dips?

However, most of the data changes over time

It appears that Kepler's sensors produces error over time
