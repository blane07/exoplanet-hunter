### Data
The Kepler space telescope observes a star's brightness. Thanks to NASA, this data is available to the public.

### Detection
When a planet passes in front of a star, it brightness dims. We can detect this dimming using the Kepler space telescope. If the dimming occurs regularly (e.g. every three days), then a planet may be orbiting that star. This is how we hunt for exoplanet candidates.

### Raw Data
The below graph shows a star's lumination over time. Notice the cyclic dips?

However, most of the data changes over time

It appears that Kepler's sensors produces error over time

### Future
The TESS satellite will scan a much larger portion of the sky compared to Kepler
